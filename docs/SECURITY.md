# Security model

BurpMCP-Ultra exposes an MCP server that can **drive your Burp Suite** — send arbitrary HTTP
requests, run scans, read your captured proxy history (which contains real requests, cookies, and
tokens), manage Collaborator, and more. Treat access to it as equivalent to control of your Burp.

For the full capability audit see `docs/security-and-capability-review.md`. This document covers the
trust boundary and the operator controls.

## Default: loopback only

Out of the box the three servers (MCP SSE `9876`/`9877`, dashboard `9878`) bind to `127.0.0.1`
only. Binding to loopback is not by itself a trust boundary (a malicious web page can target
localhost, and DNS rebinding can make responses cross-origin readable), so three independent
transport controls are always installed together (`SecurityConfig`):

1. **Host-header allowlist** — defeats DNS rebinding; a rebound request carries a `Host` not on the
   allowlist and is rejected before any handler runs.
2. **Origin lockdown** — cross-origin browser requests are rejected; CORS only ever advertises the
   configured host origins, never `anyHost()`.
3. **Per-session token** — required on every request. Accepted as an `Authorization: Bearer`
   header, an `mcp_token` cookie, a `?token=` query param, or the first URL **path** segment
   (`/<token>/`). Surfaced only in the local Burp UI (Server tab), never in logs.

   The path carrier exists because MCP clients that cannot set headers otherwise have no working
   configuration (issue #11): the SDK advertises its back-channel as the relative reference
   `?sessionId=…`, which per RFC 3986 §5.3 replaces a `?token=` query but preserves the path.
   A token in a URL is more exposed than one in a header (shell history, client config files), so
   prefer the header form when the client supports it.

   A back-channel `POST ?sessionId=…` may alternatively present a **live session id**. That id is
   a 122-bit random UUID disclosed only over an already token-authenticated SSE stream, so it is a
   capability derived from the token rather than a way around it; it cannot be guessed, and the
   Host/Origin controls above still block any browser-originated attempt to use one.

## Operator-only gates

These are set via Burp preferences / persistence. **An MCP agent cannot change them** — only the
human operator can.

| Preference | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp_scope_mode` | `warn` | Gates outbound HTTP against Burp's target scope (`off`/`warn`/`enforce`). |
| `mcp_allow_destructive` | `false` | Blocks destructive deletes, clears, shutdown and configuration import until enabled. |
| `mcp_allow_exec` | `false` | Blocks tools that register or execute operator/model-supplied code. |
| `mcp_allow_remote_bind` | `false` | **Must be `true` for any non-loopback bind to be honored** (see below). |

Set the destructive and execution gates under **BurpMCP-Ultra → Server → MCP Safety Policy**. Enabling either gate requires operator confirmation and takes effect immediately.

The compact routers require `confirm:true` in addition to the relevant operator preference.
Generic persistence tools reject every reserved `mcp_*` key, so an MCP client cannot use them
to change policy, transport, scope, or authentication settings. Scope `enforce` mode fails closed
if Burp cannot evaluate the target URL.

A durable audit trail of security-relevant tool calls is written to `~/.burpmcp-ultra-audit.jsonl`.

## Configurable bind host (issue #4 / PR #6)

You can bind the servers to a specific interface (e.g. a LAN IP, or `0.0.0.0` for all interfaces)
for cross-machine or headless-Burp setups. **This exposes Burp control to the network**, so it is
gated.

### How the gate works (`BindHostPolicy`)

The requested host resolves from `-Dburpmcp.bindHost` → the `mcp_bind_host` preference → `127.0.0.1`.
It is then classified and gated:

- **loopback** (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`) → always allowed.
- **non-loopback** (a concrete IP or `0.0.0.0`) → allowed **only if** the operator has opted in via
  `mcp_allow_remote_bind=true` (or `-Dburpmcp.allowRemoteBind=true`). Without the opt-in the request
  is **refused and downgraded to `127.0.0.1`**, with a warning.
- **invalid / blank** → downgraded to `127.0.0.1`.

When a non-loopback bind is honored:
- a `⚠ SECURITY` warning is logged (Output tab) and shown in the Server tab,
- a durable `server.remote_bind` entry is written to the audit log,
- the Host-header + CORS allowlist is extended to the configured host **and this machine's own
  interface addresses only** — so a real remote client's `Host` passes the anti-rebinding check,
  but the allowlist is still never `anyHost()`.

### Setting it

- **UI**: Server tab → *Server Bind Address* → enter the host, tick *Allow remote bind* (a
  non-loopback value triggers a confirmation of the network exposure), then **Save & Rebind Now**
  (applies live, no reload) or reload the extension.
- **JVM flags** (headless): `-Dburpmcp.bindHost=0.0.0.0 -Dburpmcp.allowRemoteBind=true`.

### What still protects you when exposed — and what does not

- **Still enforced**: the bearer token on every request, the Host/Origin allowlist, all operator
  gates. A caller without the token cannot invoke anything.
- **What you take on**: the bearer token becomes the *only* barrier between the network and full
  Burp control. There is no rate-limiting or lockout on token attempts. If the token leaks (it is
  shown in the Server tab and embedded in your MCP client config), anyone on the reachable network
  can drive your Burp.

### Recommendation

Prefer keeping loopback the default and fronting remote access with an **SSH tunnel or a reverse
proxy** you control (bound to the NIC, rewriting `Host` to a loopback allowlist entry) so the
network-side access control is explicit. Use the built-in remote bind only on trusted networks, and
revert to `127.0.0.1` when you are done.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to the maintainer (see the repo README / profile:
GitHub `Cy-S3c`, Telegram `@D4RK_V0RT3X`) rather than opening a public issue.
