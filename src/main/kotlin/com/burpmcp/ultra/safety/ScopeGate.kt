/**
 * Centralized operator-controlled outbound scope gate, shared by EVERY bridge
 * that sends requests (HTTP send/raw/chain/parallel/fuzz/race, recon, graphql,
 * webprobe). Reads the persisted enforcement mode (`mcp_scope_mode`); the agent
 * cannot change it.
 *
 * This replaces several per-bridge copies of the same logic that had drifted out
 * of sync — some send paths were ungated (ENFORCE bypassable via batch/chain/
 * fuzz/race tools), and the recon/graphql/webprobe bridges never surfaced the
 * WARN-mode flag. Funnelling every send through this one place keeps the policy
 * uniform and means a future send path cannot silently skip the gate.
 *
 * ENFORCE mode fails closed when scope cannot be evaluated. WARN and OFF keep
 * operating, with WARN returning an explicit evaluation warning.
